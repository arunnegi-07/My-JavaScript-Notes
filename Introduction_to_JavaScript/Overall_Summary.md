## Overall Summary of this Module 
-   **JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
-   It was created by **Brendan Eich** in **1995**, initially named **Mocha** and later **LiveScript** before being named **JavaScript**.
-   The **JavaScript Engine** is responsible for parsing and executing JavaScript code and is a part of the **JavaScript Runtime Environment** (JSRE).
- Every **JavaScript Engine** must follow **ECMA Script** Guidelines.
- Modern-day **JavaScript Engines**, such as the ones used in web browsers like Google Chrome (**V8**) and **Node.js**, utilize a combination of both an interpreter and a compiler, known as **Just-In-Time** (**JIT**) compilation.
-   JavaScript is **single-threaded**, executing one operation at a time in a single sequence as it contains only one **call stack**.
-   JSRE includes other components like **Event Loop**, **Web APIs**, and **Callback Queue**.
-   Web APIs allow JavaScript to interact with the browser environment, such as DOM manipulation and making HTTP requests.
-   The **Callback Queue** holds completed asynchronous tasks (callbacks) until they are executed by the Event Loop.
-   The **Event Loop** continuously monitors the Call Stack and Callback Queue, ensuring asynchronous tasks are handled efficiently.

-   JSRE components work together to provide an efficient and asynchronous execution environment for JavaScript in the browser.
